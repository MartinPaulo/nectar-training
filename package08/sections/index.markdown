This module provides an introduction to key security issues, dangers and consequences when running a virtual machine in the cloud. Practical advice for making your machine secure and preventing it from being hacked. An introduction to data encryption including usage of a variety of tools is also given.

Cloud computing has grown exponentially over the last few years. However security concerns are still quite common amongst those who are reluctant to adopt it. Is cloud computing safe? What are the common security concerns, and how justified are they?

We will talk about security concerns in this Module and describe how NeCTAR addresses security issues, and what you need to do to make your virtual machine safe and protect it.

### Note to reviewers

Not much detail is known on our side on the exact measures NeCTAR takes to ensure security. Therefore, it would be great if a comment could be made on each of the described security issues on how NeCTAR handles this, and what the user will be responsible for (In particular in section [Main threats](concerns.html)).

We can remove some security issues mentioned in [Main threats](concerns.html) if you think it will scare people off and/or it is not a risk worth mentioning. Comments on which steps NeCTAR takes to avoid the security issues are more than welcome.
