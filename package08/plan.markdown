This guide is intended to help trainers plan to present the training package.

### Duration

About 1 - 1.5 hours

### Venue

Only the last part of the course (encrypting volumes) requires users to have their Laptop (or a Lab computer).
It is possible to deliver this module with *no* hands-on exercises and only show the last
part being done by the presenter. 

The course is a lot faster if the presenter just shows the steps.

* If people should participate in exercises:
    * Venue has to fit all participants either:
        * sitting on a table with their own laptops and access to electricity
        * in a lab where each participant can use their own computer
     * Operating systems supported in the course:
         * Linux
         * Windows
         * Mac OSX
* If only presenter is demonstrating the last part:
    * Venue can be any type which fits the number of participants

### Trainers and Capacity

If presenter is demonstrating the last part (encryption), any number of participants is supported.

If people participate in exercises, it is suggested that not more than 20 people participate.
For less than 5 participants, one trainer should be sufficient.
For any additional 5-7 participants, one additional trainer should attend to help people.

### Resources required

* Projector
* Course materials (slides)
* Online documentation accessible from the lab
* If participants do the exercises in the last part:
    * All participants must have access to the NeCTAR cloud via AAF
    * Participants should have logged onto the NeCTAR dashboard before, and ideally have an instance up an running already, with a volume (or secondary ephemeral drive)  mounted on it.
