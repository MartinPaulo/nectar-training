This module provides a high-level overview of the processes involved when using the Research Cloud. More details about the specific steps involved will be provided in the later modules --- this module will only focus on a high-level overview.

Topics will include: how to get onto the research cloud, necessary housekeeping you will need to do (e.g. updates, backups) and how to keep your VM secure. Finally, you will learn about terminating services without losing anything, and how to get support.

### How to get an allocation

* Any researcher who logs on to the web Dashboard can immediately have access to a small **Project Trial** allocation (2 instances and 2 cores for 3 months). A *Project* provides access to a certain allocation of resources.
Project Trials have names like *pt-8637*. 
Within your default allocation you can run:    
    * a medium (two core) instance, or
    * two small (single core) instances.

* You can run instances of various sizes on the cloud, from one to 16 cores, and from one instance to hundreds.
However to obtain such a larger allocation you need to submit an allocation request through the web Dashboard. 
We will talk more about how to do this [later in this Module](allocations.html).

* Allocation requests are reviewed by an allocation committee and awarded based on *merit*, suitability to cloud use, and available capacity of the cloud.

* Before making an allocation request it is best to discuss your requirements with your local eResearch office or IT services. You may easily get access to resources available to your organisation.

You can find more information on the [NeCTAR website for allocations](http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/docs/allocations).
