You want shared access to data to collaborate with other researchers. You may request the amount of storage you require and give collaborators access to the on-line storage.

Depending on your needs, you may request a *block of storage*, which will be accessible as a hard drive. Collaborators need to log in to the virtual machine which has the hard-drive attached to it in order to copy files. 
An easier way is to use *object storage*, to which easy-to-use interfaces (e.g. via web browser) are available for any collaborate to upload individual files to.     

Types of storage and access to it will be introduced in [Module 6][ModDoc6] and further discussed in the later modules.
