You want to develop your own research app that can be accessed from a variety of devices and from anywhere, from several people simultaneously. For example, you want to undertake a field study. Your students and collaborators venture out to collect data and upload their results and materials directly to your app on the Research Cloud. There is no need to deal with a large amount of E-mails in which people send their results as attachments.

You can install and run your app on a virtual machine. In [Module 7][ModDoc7], we will discuss how to set up and access a virtual machine.
