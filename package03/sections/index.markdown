> "The data tsunami is changing everything in science. Every discipline is now confronted with it—a vast exploration of data that comes from instruments, from online sources, from the web, from social media. Analyzing this data can’t be done on a PC."

— Dennis Gannon, director of Cloud Research Strategy for Microsoft Research Connections

This module will discuss five fast ways to make the cloud work for your research. Common use cases for the NeCTAR Research Cloud and the research outcomes they can enable will be described.

### The Research Cloud

The Research Cloud provides the necessary processing power and storage that is required for computationally and  storage intensive projects. That means the users of the application do not need to have huge processing power or storage capabilities locally. Cloud computing allows us to eliminate the use of standalone machines and provides all parties equal access to the models and data on a standard platform.

The NeCTAR National Research Cloud empowers researchers with new self-service abilities to publish research data, share knowledge and rapidly deploy and access software applications without the burden of operating their own computer servers.

The NeCTAR Research Cloud Services provide an **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)**: Researchers can run their own virtual machines and manage their storage.

{% BgBox info %}
The Research Cloud uses the successful, open-source *OpenStack* cloud computing software platform. OpenStack APIs are compatible with *Amazon EC2* (Amazon's computing service) and *Amazon S3* (Amazon's object storage service) and thus client applications written for *Amazon Web Services (AWS)* can be used with OpenStack and NeCTAR Services with minimal porting effort. Conversely, you will be able to port to *AWS* after developing using the NeCTAR services.

To illustrate a few examples in which you may benefit from using the Research Cloud, we will discuss a few common use cases in this Module.
