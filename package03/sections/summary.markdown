This is the end of Module 3. You should now have a better idea of what uses and benefits the Research Cloud can have. You may have identified one or a few use cases that apply to your research. 

The following use cases have been discussed:

1. Embarrassingly parallel problems (EPP) 
2. Data Sharing with other researchers
3. On-demand Computing for research and teaching 
4. Remote Access to services from anywhere
5. Developing a Research App 
6. Reproducible Research 
7. Teaching 
8. Big Data demands 

However there is a lot more to it---there are plenty more use cases. After following the next Modules, you will know enough about the Research Cloud to identify your very own and individual use case.

You may now continue with [Module 4][ModDoc4].
