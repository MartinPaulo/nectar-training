This is the end of Module 3. You should now have a better idea of what uses and benefits the Research Cloud can have. You may have identified one or a few use cases that apply to your research. 

The following use cases have been discussed:

1. Embarassingly parallel problems (EPP) 
2. Data Sharing with other researchers
3. On-demand Computing for research and teaching 
4. Remote Access to services from anywhere
5. Developing a Research App 
6. Reproducible Research 
7. Teaching 
8. Big Data demands 

You may now continue with [Module 4][ModDoc4].
