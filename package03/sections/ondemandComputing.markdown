You need compute power only at a certain time (on-demand), e.g. when results for a paper need to be processed quickly. You don't need to invest in a large amount of PCs which take up space in your office, sitting idle until they are needed, and becoming outdated within a few years.

You can easily access the required amount of computing power and storage in the cloud, only for the time you need to run your experiments. You don't have to worry about maintenance and re-investment in new, faster computers. 

In [Module 7][ModDoc7], we will discuss how to set up and access a virtual machine.
