**File Access:**    
*Volume* or *Block* storage can be seen as what we know as a partition of a harddrive (or a whole hard drive), containing a lot of files in one whole block. Files are accessed with traditional file access methods.
In the *Object Storage*, you access an *object* using a *http* based interface. Anyone who has stored a picture on *Facebook* or a song on *Spotify* has used Object Storage even if they don’t know it. 

**Distribution:**    
*Object Storage* is a per-file based storage system which stores each file at several locations --- you won’t know where exactly the individual files are stored, they may even not all be on the same harddrive. In contrast, *Volume Storage* is one larger block of storage which contains several files, located at one location.
