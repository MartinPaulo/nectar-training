The previous modules have discussed what the research cloud is, what a virtual machine is and how you can use it for your research. You may now ask yourself: How many instances do I require? How many CPU cores per instance? How much storage can I get, and what types of storage are available? 

In this module we will discuss factors which help you determine the amount of resources (computing and storage) you require. We will take a look at the different types of storage that are available to you, which will help you decide which type is most suitable for your research purposes.
