The previous modules have discussed what the research cloud is, what a virtual machine is and how you can use it for your research. You may now ask yourself: How many instances do I require? How many CPU cores per instance? How much storage can I get, and what types of storage are available? 

In this module we will discuss factors which help you determine the amount of resources (computing and storage) you require. We will take a look at the different types of storage that are available to you, which will help you decide which type is most suitable for your research purposes.

When describing the different storage types, parts of the text have been taken from the nectar support website and extended with more details. If it is not the aim to replace that documentation with this one, the text below can be edited to not contain the same descriptions.

This module only covers an overview of the storage, connecting and accessing to the storage are handled in the later modules.

The current state of the documentation assumes that users will be able to use Sahara (it is referenced from [Can I benefit from several instances?](instanceNumbers.html). Please notify us if this will not be possible.
