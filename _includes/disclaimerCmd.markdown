The use of command line tools is part of this course. In a *Terminal*, you will be directed to type in *commands*. Commands are formatted as follows:

```command-name argument1 argument2 ... argumentn```

Throughout the exercises, when you see a word in pointed brackets, like &lt;*this-word*&gt;, it means that you have to replace everything inside the brackets, and *including the brackets*, with whatever is described within the brackets.

For example, if you are prompted to run a command named *the-command* which takes two arguments:

```the-command -f <yourfile>```

Then you have to replace the second argument, &lt;yourfile&gt;, with the *file name* that is being referenced in the exercise. For example

```the-command -f thefile.txt```

When we edit a file, the contents of it will be displayed in a different font and with background colour as follows:

{% BgBox edit %}
   The content of the file

   The next line in this file
{% endBgBox %}

Output on the command line terminal is printed in boxes formatted as follows:

{% BgBox terminal %}
NectarTrainingPC:~ Jennifer$ whoami

Jennifer
{% endBgBox %}
