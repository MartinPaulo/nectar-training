This module is designed for advanced users who want to learn more about command line tools to control the NeCTAR resources. This can help to automate procedures, for example with scripts for backup processes. Worked examples of the OpenStack command line tool *openstack* are included in this Module. 

The previous modules have covered all you need to know to get started with the Research Cloud --- this module is going to show how all of this can be done using only a few command line tools.
If you are not comfortable with the command line, rest assured that you already have all knowledge required to work with the Cloud using the Dashboard and the other tools discussed in previous Modules. If you like using the command line to get things done, you will *love* the extra information given in this module!
 
The following topics are going to be covered:

* Installation of OpenStack command line clients
* Launching and terminating an instance
* Taking snapshots of instances and relaunching from snapshots 
* Creating and deleting volumes
* Making backups and taking snapshots of volumes
* Accessing the object store
