There are a number of common concerns among people who are about to make the decision whether to move their computing resources and storage to the cloud. Such concerns include

* Privacy & Security	

* Portability of tools and data to and from different cloud platforms

* Uncertainty in cost prediction

* Absence of software tools

In this course we will discuss such concerns and how NeCTAR addresses them in order to make cloud computing more accessible to researchers. In particular, [Module 8](/package08/) is going to cover security related topics.
