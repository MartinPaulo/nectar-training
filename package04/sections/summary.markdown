**Hurray!**

You should now have a good idea about the difference between Cloud and HPC. 

If you have found that the Cloud is a great choice for your research IT infrastructure, you will enjoy the rest of this course.

You may have found that HPC is the right choice for you, in which case you can go on to find out more about your options to use HPC computing. Contact your local IT department to find out more. You may also be interested to take a look at the [Intersect course](http://www.intersect.org.au/content/training) "Introduction to Unix for HPC".

Maybe you will be able to identify use cases in your future research, in which case you will be all prepared!

In summary, this module has discussed:

* The difference between Cloud an HPC
