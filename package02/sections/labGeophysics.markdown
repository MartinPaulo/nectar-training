The **Virtual GeophysicsLaboratory** has developed a portal, a workflow system and computational tools to access geological survey data in standard formats from multiple data providers. It provides Geophysicists with access to an integrated environment that exploits eResearch tools and Cloud computing technology. In particular, it uses the Cloud or the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) supercomputer to run automated workflows constructed from standard analysis tools.

The website provides more information about the Geophysics Virtual Laboratory.
