**Target field(s):** Various disciplines: Digital data collection.

**Website:** [www.fedarch.org](http://www.fedarch.org/)

**Maintained by:** University of NSW

The **Federated Archaeological Information Management Systems (FAIMS)** project builds tools for digital data collection in the field, and online processing and archiving of the resulting data: it is a suite of digital tools for all stages of the digital data collection lifecycle. 

Flexible and scalable, FAIMS is designed to work with any workflow, ontology or standard. FAIMS is so flexible it can be used with any research discipline involving fieldwork data collection.

FAIMS provides three products:

* The **FAIMS mobile platform** to collect information digitally in the field using Android devices.

* The **FAIMS web tools** to analyze and visualize your data.

* The **FAIMS repository** to preserve your data and make it available to other researchers.

Project staff also advise researchers concerning the development of data management strategies that meet the requirements of major grant schemes and improve research outcomes.
