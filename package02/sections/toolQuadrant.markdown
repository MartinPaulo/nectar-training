**Quadrant** is a cloud-based project management and data collection software tool that allows participant-based researchers to work collaboratively and efficiently from a self-managed centralised site.
It was designed to address the need for **secure and ethical online research project management and data storage**.

Quadrant streamlines the research process by making it easy to collect, view, and track the progress of research data at all points throughout the project. 
It increases research efficiency by removing task duplication associated with using disparate programs such as email, spreadsheets, and file sharing tools to share data, track and manage research. Quadrant promotes independent team activity and accountability whilst enabling executive level access and control. It simultaneously provides a current snapshot of project progress as well as specific details about individual participants or subjects.
