The **Ark project** was established within the Centre for Genetic Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of Western Australia in late 2009 to develop an open-source platform to support Australian and International biomedical researchers. The objective of The Ark project is to provide a suite of secure, integrated web-based tools that incorporate the majority of the functionality required to conduct a complex study or clinical trial.
