The **Virtual Hazards, Impact and Risk Laboratory (VHIRL)** will be the agent that transforms the user from a single participant working locally to one connected to a broader community. It will integrate data, models and workflows to develop information that builds community resilience.

The VHIRL lab

* Models will estimate the generation and propagation of natural hazards across the earthâ€™s surface and through the atmosphere
* Estimate the subsequent impact on people and buildings
* Workflows will define how the models can be used for different end user requirements
