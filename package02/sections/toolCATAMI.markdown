The **Collaborative and Automated Tools for the analysis of marine imagery and video (CATAMI)**
is a collection of tools designed to assist marine ecology and habitat monitoring processes.

Currently there is a lack of standardised approaches to the methodology, annotation, classification and analysis of marine imagery. This makes comparison across disparate sites as well as further analysis very difficult. The CATAMI project aims to help solve some of these issues by enabling the aggregation of information derived from imagery through releasing a standardised classification scheme.
