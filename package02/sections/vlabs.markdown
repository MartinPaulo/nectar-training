NeCTAR's Virtual Laboratories are creating a new era of connectivity for Australian researchers. They aim at connecting researchers with existing and new research facilities, data repositories and computational tools and streamlining research workflows. They help to create new opportunities for collaboration, efficiencies and innovation.

A Virtual Laboratory can be seen as a portal to several software tools, data, storage and documentation in an integrated and interactive environment, enabling researchers across the world to collaborate and share information.

Virtual Laboratories are developing online, **discipline-specific research environments** that integrate data repositories, computational tools and workflows.

**Aims**

* Provide remote-access to Labs to students and researchers.

* Encourage students by arousing curiousity.

* Help students to learn basic and advanced concepts through remote experimentation and providing tools for learning (e.g. web-resources, video lectures and demonstrations)

* Share resources which are otherwise available to a limited number of users only (e.g. due to geographical distances â€“ share your data and tools with collaborators).

    * providing an environment which enables a group of researchers around the world to work together on a common set of problems	

    * allow scientists located around the world to collaborate efficiently - not simply at a meeting, but in an ongoing way

* Provide an interactive environment for creating and conducting simulated experiments

* Consists of any or several of:

    * Tools for processing and analysis	

    * Storage 		

    * Models (e.g. ocean circulation, waves, water quality, and marine biogeochemistry 	at the *Marine Virtual Laboratory*)		

    * Networks of observing stations / sensors (e.g.*Marine Virtual Laboratory*)

    * Access to data sets

    * Support teams

    * Tutorials

    * Management of clusters (e.g. [www.genomics.edu.au](http://www.genomics.edu.au))

**Examples include**

* Studying and forecasting weather patterns (*Climate and Weather Science*)

* Cross-disciplinary interaction and information sharing between researchers (*Human Communication Science Virtual Laboratory* for researchers from several disciplines: speech science, computer science, behavioural science, linguistics, music cognition and musicology, sonics and acoustics)
