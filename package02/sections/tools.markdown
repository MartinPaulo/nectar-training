NeCTAR eResearch Tools provide research software for the Australian research community and address specific research needs. The eResearch tools program has a strong focus on enhancing existing tools and applications to be more collaborative, accessible and support research workflows. 

eResearch Tools are tools specifically developed for research. Some of them are provided on github servers which are hosted on the NeCTAR infrastructure, others are web-based. Many tools have* *integrated data sharing.

### Examples

* *Drishti and Voluminous* are scientific **visualisation and analysis** tools. *Drishti* is a component of the NeCTAR Characterisation Virtual Laboratory and *Voluminous* is a web-based application. [Link to Drishti and Voluminous](http://anusf.anu.edu.au/Vizlab/drishti/)

* *OzTrack*: easy to use, sophisticated **analysis and visualization** features to researchers, including ecologists, biologists, resource and wildlife managers. The project encourages the aggregation, preservation, and potential re-use, of animal telemetry data. This is a free-to-use web-based platform for analysing and visualising animal location data. [Link to OzTrack](http://oztrack.org/) 	 	

* **Cloud-based image analysis**: This web-based toolbox allows free access to wide range of useful blocks of functionality that can be connected together in workflows allowing creation of even more complex algorithms that can be re-run on different data sets, shared with others. [Link to CloudImaging](http://cloudimaging.net.au/)

* The *Human Variome Project* is a national **data sharing facility** for improving clinical genetic testing services and supporting medical research. Helping Australian diagnostic laboratories deliver better results for patients through secure data sharing. 

* *Quadrant*: This cloud-based **project management and data collection** software tool enables participant-based researchers to work collaboratively and efficiently from a self-managed centralised site. Removes duplication from using disparate programs such as email, spreadsheets, and file sharing tools to share data, track and manage research. [Link to Quadrant](http://www.quadrant.edu.au/)
