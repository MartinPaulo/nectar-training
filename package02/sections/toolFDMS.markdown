**Website:** [www.fedarch.org](http://www.fedarch.org/)

**Maintained by:** Macquarie University

The **Field Data Management System** (FDMS) project builds tools for digital data collection in the field, and online processing and archiving of the resulting data: it is a suite of digital tools for all stages of the digital data collection lifecycle. 

Flexible and scalable, FDMS is designed to work with any workflow, ontology or standard. FDMS is so flexible it can be used with any research discipline involving fieldwork data collection.

FDMS provides three products:

* The **FDMS mobile platform** to collect information digitally in the field using Android devices.

* The **FDMS web tools** to analyze and visualize your data.

* The **FDMS repository** to preserve your data and make it available to other researchers.

Project staff also advise researchers concerning the development of data management strategies that meet the requirements of major grant schemes and improve research outcomes.
