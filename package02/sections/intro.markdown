This module provides an overview of the *eResearch Tools* and the *Virtual Laboratories* that are offered by NeCTAR services. Both the eResearch Tools and the Virtual Labs offer *"ready to go"* tools for researchers to use.

The NeCTAR project has funded the development of customised cloud services, software and portals for particular research disciplines or workflows. Among those services, you may find one which is useful for your research activities.  In this module, we will discuss the eResearch tools and Virtual Laboratories.

In a few words,

* *Virtual Laboratories* provide online **platforms** for research activities in several research discipline areas.

* *eResearch Tools* provide online **software tools** for common research tasks.
