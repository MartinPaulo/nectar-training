The **Climate and Weather Science** Virtual Laboratory for studying and forecasting weather patterns.

The Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO and the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) at The Australian National University are partners in the development of a new Virtual Laboratory.  The Climate and Weather Science Laboratory will provide an integrated national facility for model development, the provision and assessment of climate and weather simulations, and establish a readily available archive of climate and weather data.

The virtual laboratory's goal is to:

* Enrich scientists' access to resources,
* Reduce the technical barriers to using state of the art tools,
* Racilitate the sharing of experiments and results,
* Reduce the time to conduct scientific research studies, and
* Elevate the collaboration and contributions by the Australian research community to the development of the Australian Community Climate Earth-System Simulator (ACCESS).
