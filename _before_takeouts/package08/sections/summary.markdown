**Congratulations!**

You are now finished with this Module. You should now be aware of general security concerns in the cloud, and know how risks can be mitigated by the cloud provider *and* by you. Deployment methods of cloud services (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) and how they affect security have been introduced. Practical advice has been given for hardening a machine: passwords and passphrases, updates/patches, blocking ports, etc. Finally, this module has also provided some hands-on exercises on how to encrypt data (both individual files, and entire volumes on the instance).

In summary, this module has covered:

* Common security concerns when using the Cloud.
* How cloud provider *and* the user can mitigate such risks
* Cloud deployment models
* File and Volume Encryption

You are now ready to continue with [Module 9][ModDoc9].
