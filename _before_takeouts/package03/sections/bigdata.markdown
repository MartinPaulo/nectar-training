You have "big data" demands: you need easy and quick access to large amounts of storage. 

When you process this data with your dedicated application, your running application should be "close to the data": it should run on a computer which is directly attached to the storage via a faster connection than the Internet. Therefore, it is not a good solution to only request storage from some on-line storage provider and then hook up your office computer with the storage via the network and then process the from your office computer --- this may take forever! So you need a computer running at the same facilities as your storage is physically located. The Research Cloud enables you to do that: you can request storage and and a virtual machine at the same facilities and then analyze your data with your virutal machine.

[Module 7][ModDoc7] will go into detail about creating a virtual machine, set up your storage, and hook it up with your VM.
