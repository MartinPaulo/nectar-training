{% include /docLinks.markdown %}

You want to provide a snapshot of your virtual machine including all tools, data and documentation required to reproduce the results. You may even want to cite this snapshot in a paper, so other researchers who would like to to reproduce your experiments can launch the virtual machine and have access to your entire experimental environment: the code, the data, notes, etc. There is no need for them to install a set of complex, version-sensitive programs with inter-dependencies. Reproducibility is facilitated and this appraoch also takes a lot of work off the researcher. 

[Module 9][ModDoc9] will discuss how you can create a snapshot of your VM and share it with others.
