NeCTAR has a great support team. There are several ways to get support:

* If you need help with using the Research Cloud or advice on other cloud solutions, first contact your local eResearch office or IT services.

* The NeCTAR project also offers online user guides and technical support through their[ NeCTAR Research Cloud support site](http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/). 

* Support for the NeCTAR Research Cloud is handled by NeCTAR and available weekdays 9am AEST to 5pm AWST.

    1. First read the [known issues](http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/144) and [FAQ](http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/102) for known problems.

    2. Search the [support site](http://support.rc.nectar.org.au): Forum posts and support tickets may have answers or show an issue is already reported.

    3. See if your issue is supported (see ["Issues Support Staff will respond to"](http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/75)â€œ)

    4. Otherwise, email a *support request* following the instructions at the [NeCTAR support site](http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/docs/getting-support).  You may also get answers at the [NeCTAR Community Forum](http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/forum).
