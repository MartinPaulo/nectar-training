### Synopsis

This module will discuss the differences between Cloud Computing and HPC, and provide an overview of pros and cons of moving from traditional desktop computing to Cloud or HPC infrastructure. Key factors that affect the choice between computing in the cloud and on a HPC system will be discussed.

### Content

This module will discuss

* The difference between Cloud an HPC
* When to use HPC
* When to use Cloud Computing
* Pros and cons of the Cloud 

### Delivery

* face to face
* video

### Outcomes

The researcher will know the difference between Cloud and HPC. They may have found that HPC is the right choice for them, in which case they don't need to attend the next Modules, and instead find out about their options to get access to HPC (e.g. attend the Intersect "Introduction to Unix & HPC" course). Or they may find that the Cloud satisfies their requirements, and they will have gained motivation to attend the rest of the course.

### Course suitable for

Researchers who are currently using a PC for analysis. They want to know what they gain and lose by moving to centralised compute. They also want to know when to choose a VM over the other available option, HPC.

### Before the course

No preparation needed for this module.
