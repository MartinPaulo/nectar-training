In this module, you have learned what eResearch tools and Virtual Laboratories are. You should now have a general idea of what *Virtual Labs* and *eResearch tools* are and maybe you have found a tool that is "ready to use" for you.

In summary, Virtual Labs *vs* eResearch Tools:

* Virtual labs:
    * on-line platforms offering a collection of **discipline-specific** tools and data.
    * create **new platforms** for collaboration and information sharing.
* eResearch tools:
    * offer a variety of research software for the Australian research community, often addressing researchers **across disciplines**.
    * focus on **enhancing existing tools** and applications.

If you have not identified any tool or virtual lab that you may benefit from, there is still one major NeCTAR service which you will be interested in: The Research Cloud. The next modules will cover usage of Cloud Computing for your research.

Continue with [Module 3][ModDoc3] which will discuss a few common use cases for the NeCTAR Research Cloud.
