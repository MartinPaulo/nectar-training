NeCTAR eResearch Tools provide research software for the Australian research community and address specific research needs. The eResearch tools program has a strong focus on enhancing existing tools and applications to be more collaborative, accessible and support research workflows. 

NeCTAR [eResearch Tools](http://www.nectar.org.au/eresearch-tools) are tools specifically developed for research. Some of them are provided on github servers which are hosted on the NeCTAR infrastructure, others are web-based. Many tools have integrated data sharing.

### Examples

* [Drishti and Voluminous](http://anusf.anu.edu.au/Vizlab/drishti/) are scientific **visualisation and analysis** tools. *Drishti* is a component of the NeCTAR Characterisation Virtual Laboratory and *Voluminous* is a web-based application. 


* [OzTrack](http://oztrack.org/): easy to use, sophisticated **analysis and visualization** features to researchers, including ecologists, biologists, resource and wildlife managers. The project encourages the aggregation, preservation, and potential re-use, of animal telemetry data. This is a free-to-use web-based platform for analysing and visualising animal location data. 

* [Cloud-based image analysis (CloudImaging)](http://cloudimaging.net.au/): This web-based toolbox allows free access to wide range of useful blocks of functionality that can be connected together in workflows allowing creation of even more complex algorithms that can be re-run on different data sets, shared with others. 

* The [Human Variome Project](http://www.nectar.org.au/human-variome-project-australian-node) is a national **data sharing facility** for improving clinical genetic testing services and supporting medical research. Helping Australian diagnostic laboratories deliver better results for patients through secure data sharing. 

* [Quadrant](https://nectar.org.au/quadrant): A tool for managing research projects, particularly for participant-based research. This **project management and data collection** software tool enables researchers to work collaboratively and efficiently from a self-managed centralised site. Removes duplication from using disparate programs such as email, spreadsheets, and file sharing tools to share data, track and manage research. See also: [Quadrant website](http://www.quadrant.edu.au/)

* [MyTardis](http://www.nectar.org.au/bioscience-data-platform-tardis-cloud) is a tool which provides a repository for characterisation and bioscience data.
The [Image analysis and processing toolbox](http://www.nectar.org.au/cloud-based-image-analysis-and-processing-toolbox) is particularly for medical imaging.

* [Federated Archaeological Information Management System](http://www.nectar.org.au/federated-archaeological-information-management-system): This eResearch tool includes [The Ark project](http://www.nectar.org.au/cloud-based-bio-informatics-tools) which provides tools to support medical studies and clinical trials.

* The [SHaRED](http://www.nectar.org.au/submission-harmonisation-and-retrieval-ecological-data-shared) porject (submission, harmonisation and retrieval of ecological data) is a tool that provides an online questionnaire to help structure metadata when uploading data files.   
 

* The [High-throughput Computing For Globally Connected Science](http://nectar.org.au/projects/high-throughput-computing-globally-connected-science#overlay-context=users/lyndae) eResearch Tools will provide tools and underlying infrastructure for high throughput projects across disciplinesâ€”initially only for processing high-energy physics data from the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
